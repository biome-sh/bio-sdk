# The Biome SDK

This project aimed to enhance habitat development experience by providing additional `hab`-commands.

**IN DEVELOPMENT**

# Quick Start

## Use in Biome Studio

Add to `.studiorc` or run manually in studio:

``` bash
# By default all required tools like shellcheck, bats are not installed automatically.
# This reduces install time and adds flexibility.

bio pkg install -fb ya/bio-sdk
bio pkg install -fb core/shellcheck
bio pkg install -fb ya/tomlcheck
```

## Install as CLI

Make sure you have required binaries, like `shellcheck`.

``` bash
sudo bio pkg install -fb ya/bio-sdk
```

## Use in build process

Update your `plan.sh`:

``` bash
...
# Make sure you have required binaries, like `shellcheck`.
pkg_build_deps+=(ya/bio-sdk core/shellcheck)

...

do_prepare() {
  bio-plan-shellcheck $PLAN_CONTEXT
}
```

# Configuration

Optionally you can add `plan.toml` file into `$PLAN_CONTEXT`, near the `plan.sh` file or in parent directory.

Plan Configuration principles are:

* Each section name maps to a corresponding `bio-plan-<thing>` cli.
* Each command line option maps to corresponding option inside the section
* Configuration applies in the following order (last wins):
* * Default Options (sane defaults are embedded into cli)
* * User Options (provided by `plan.toml`)
* * Command line options (specified by user in command line)
* For each `list`-like option:
* *  `add-list` and `remove-list` options are generated
* * Final `list` option is generated by `add-list - remove-list` formula.
* Some options are actually `path` options. You can use globs:
* * `plan.sh` - exactly file `plan.sh`
* * `*/habitat/plan.sh` - files `plan.sh` in any directory with the `habitat` sub-directory
* * `src/**/plan.sh` - files `plan.sh` in `src` and its sub-directories. **On huge trees can be slow**
* * All file path-s are either expanded to a full path or treated from `$PLAN_CONTEXT`s directory

## Configuration Example

Here is `plan.toml` example:

``` toml
# Name of the bio-plan-<thing>
[shellcheck]
# Debug can be turned on separately for each cli
debug = true

# You can glob outside of context
add-path = ["../../*.sh"]

# Remove applied after add. `hooks` directory by default added. You can exclude hook
remove-path = ["hook/annoying-hook"]

# Make shellcheck also exclude SC2154
add-exclude = ["SC2154"]

# By default shellcheck has the following excludes:
# ['SC1090', 'SC1091', 'SC2034']
# I don't want to ignore SC1090, so remove from exclude list:
remove-exclude = ["SC1090"]

[tomlcheck]
# check also all toml files in the config directory
add-path = ["config/*.toml"]

[rendercheck]
# Make bio-plan-render to print templates to stdout
print = true
```

# Commands

## bio-plan-tomlcheck

Validates your toml files using `tomlcheck`.

## bio-plan-shellcheck

Validates your shell scripts using `shellcheck`

## bio-plan-rendercheck

Renders and test your configuration. By default `bio-plan-rendercheck` renders all configuration to `results/tests/render/default` directory.

`bio-plan-rendercheck` works with suites - directories with or without files. By default it uses `tests/render/*` directories relative to plan context. If no suites found emulates empty default one.

For each suite `bio-plan-rendercheck` tries to load `user.toml`, `mock-data.json`, `default.toml` from `suite` directory, suites' parent directory or from plan context directory.
Each suite `bio-plan-rendercheck` renders templates into `results/tests/render/<suite>`
For each suite `bio-plan-rendercheck` compares using `diff` rendered files in `results/tests/render/<suite>` with `tests/render/<suite>` in plan context.

If expected template or config is absent it safely ignored.

You can test different scenarios using `suites`. Let imagine we need to test 3 configuration scenarios for a package:

* `standalone` - configuration with most defaults
* `cluster` - mode for service rings
* `custom` - custom user configuration for some edge cases

Create suites directories:

```bash
mkdir -p tests/render/{standalone,cluster,custom}
```

Create mock data files. We can share same file by creating it in the suites' parent directory:

```bash
vim tests/render/mock-data.json

# But for cluster suite we want another mock-data
vim tests/render/cluster/mock-data.json
```

Create custom user configuration:

```bash
vim tests/render/custom/user.toml
```

Run rendering:

```bash
bio-plan-rendercheck
```

On success you will get number of rendered files:

```
results/tests/render/standalone/config/config.json
results/tests/render/standalone/hooks/run
results/tests/render/cluster/config/config.json
results/tests/render/cluster/hooks/run
results/tests/render/custom/config/config.json
results/tests/render/custom/hooks/run
```

Now inspect files. If they are ok we can easily convert them to _expected_ templates:

```bash
cp -r results/tests tests
```

Now suites contain configuration files so `bio-plan-rendercheck` will compare _expected_ and _actual_.


## bio-depot-sync

Mirrors habitat builders

# TODO

Possible commands:

* TODO: bio-plan-bats
* TODO: bio-plan-inspec
* TODO: bio-plan-delmo
* TODO: bio-plan-format - is it really needed?
* TODO: bio-plan-precommit - integration with precommit?

# Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
